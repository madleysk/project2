# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

In this project we have implemented a chat platform.
It's a single page application which allows users to chat between them in a chatroom or privately.
There are two HTML files and a Javascript file in the project.

1. layout.html:
In this file you'll find the main jinja2 template inherited by other pages in the project. But in this case it's just one page, the index.html page.

2. index.html:
In this page there are the html elements that appear in the chat application. Interaction is assured by javascript.

3. javascript.js:
In this page are loocated all the interaction functions that maks the page work properly.
